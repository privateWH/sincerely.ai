Being Good is hard. 
Being fair to the one that are good to you even harder.
Especially, if they serve similar purposes.
In the context, if I get medication from Safeway and Walgreen.
It was great to get the service from Safeway.
But when I saw Walgreen with no people show up in the Pharmacy, I want to support them.

There is brand loyalty, but there is also supporting for the "under-dog".

This if taking from even general situtation.

A rich person do good thing for you. so you remember them and want to give back to them.
And then you saw someone who wants to help.
But you can only spend a dollar on one, how would solve the situation? 
50% 50%? Or let the rich person know, there is also someone who needs help. Maybe you can help them too?
And if the Rich person doesn't? ( Will I still appreciate the things that he does for me? and will I still consider the rich person as generous as it was before?)

I think the good already occured.
And is only recommendation that to let others that can help offer the hand in helping.

But, still how would I spend that 1 dollar when it must spent?
Once in a while on both?

sincerely.ai
was the app i want to say to my peers when times I feel wrong but I never got the voice to say it, because everything moves so fast.

and there is secrecy i think is important because some guilt is embrassing to talk to at times.
is not that i cant be say right a way, but rather a truhful and honest moment to do so.

i am a believer in honest and truthful yet consider the potential harm and negative consequences or pride. therefore, i either choose silent or lie.
but i know the moon is with me, because i can be honest to it.

someday i have chase the drawn...
maybe the sun.
